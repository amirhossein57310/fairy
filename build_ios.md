# iOS Build and Permission Fix Guide

## What We Fixed

1. **Updated iOS Info.plist** with proper permission descriptions
2. **Enhanced permission handling** in the app with better error messages
3. **Added permission status screen** to help users understand what's needed
4. **Improved UI** to show permission issues clearly with action buttons

## Steps to Build and Test

### 1. Clean and Get Dependencies
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Build for iOS
```bash
flutter build ios
```

### 3. Open in Xcode (if needed)
```bash
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace
```

### 4. Test on iOS Device
- Connect your iOS device
- Make sure it's trusted in Xcode
- Run the app from Xcode or use `flutter run`

## Permission Requirements

The app now properly requests these permissions:

- **Bluetooth**: Required for connecting to Fairy device
- **Bluetooth Connect**: Required for establishing connections
- **Bluetooth Scan**: Required for discovering devices
- **Location**: Required on iOS for Bluetooth scanning

## What to Expect

1. **First Launch**: App will request all permissions
2. **Permission Denied**: App shows clear message with Settings button
3. **Permission Status**: Tap the shield icon to see detailed permission status
4. **Refresh Permissions**: Use the "Refresh Permissions" button after enabling in Settings

## Troubleshooting

If permissions still don't work:

1. **Check iOS Settings**:
   - Settings > Privacy & Security > Bluetooth
   - Settings > Privacy & Security > Location Services

2. **Reset Permissions**:
   - Settings > General > Reset > Reset Location & Privacy

3. **Reinstall App**: Delete and reinstall the app
